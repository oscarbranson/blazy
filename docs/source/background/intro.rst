What is B-Lazy?
##################

*Do you need to calculate C and B speciation in solutions? Are your solutions different from normal seawater?
Does PHREEQC confuse and terrify you?!*

B-Lazy is is designed to take the pain out of solution speciation calculations, allowing you to choose the best speciation databse for your experiments, test the impact of database choice on your results, and even do things like use Monte-Carlo methods to propagate your measurement uncertainties.
